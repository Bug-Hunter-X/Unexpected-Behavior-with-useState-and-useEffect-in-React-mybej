# Unexpected Behavior with useState and useEffect in React

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the interaction between React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.  When `setCount` is called multiple times within a single render cycle, the effect might not update as expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect state updates.

The bug is showcased in `bug.js`, while the solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. This example highlights the importance of understanding how React's state update mechanism works, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or multiple state updates within a single function call.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Observe the console output and the button's behavior.
